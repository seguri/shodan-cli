# shodan-cli

An easy way to run the `shodan` cli.

The quickest way to get started is to install [just](https://github.com/casey/just) and run:

```
just install
just init
just shodan [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...
```

## Development

If you plan to write some python code, replace `just install` with `just install-dev`.
